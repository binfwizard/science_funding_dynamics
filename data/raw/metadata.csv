GRANT CLEANING METADATA,
"The datasets PrimeAwardSummaries_2018.csv through PrimeAwardSummaries_2025.csv contain annual federal grant award records downloaded from the USAspending.gov database. Each file represents a single fiscal year from 2018 to 2025 and includes detailed information on prime award grants issued by major U.S. science funding agencies: National Institutes of Health (NIH/HHS), National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Energy (DOE), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Department of Defense (DoD). These datasets include key award-level variables such as obligated funding amount, agency, assistance type, award dates, and recipient information. They were used to examine trends over time in grant funding, volume, and cancellation rates across fiscal years.",
