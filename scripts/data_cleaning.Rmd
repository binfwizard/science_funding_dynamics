This .Rmd assumes the working directory is the project root and that raw CSVs are stored in data/raw/.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r load packages}
library(tidyverse)   
library(lubridate)   # date handling
library(janitor)     # clean_names()
library(here)        # safe relative paths

# set seed for sampling
set.seed(123)

```

```{r merge data}
